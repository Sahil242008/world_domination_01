# World Domination Game - Design Document

## Game Concept
"Global Conquest" is a turn-based strategy game where players aim to conquer the world by capturing territories, managing resources, and building armies. The game features a stylized world map divided into regions that players can capture and control.

## Game Objectives
- Conquer territories across the world map
- Build and manage armies
- Collect and manage resources
- Develop technologies to gain advantages
- Achieve world domination by controlling a majority of territories or eliminating opponents

## Core Mechanics

### Map and Territories
- The world is divided into 20-25 distinct territories
- Each territory has:
  - A name
  - Resource production value
  - Strategic importance (affects victory conditions)
  - Adjacent territories (for movement and attacks)

### Resources
- Gold: Used for building armies and structures
- Production: Affects how quickly armies can be built
- Technology points: Used to research advantages

### Armies and Combat
- Players can build armies in territories they control
- Army strength is represented by a numerical value
- Combat is resolved through a combination of army strength and random factors
- Attacking requires having more armies than the minimum garrison needed to hold a territory

### Turn Structure
1. Resource collection phase
2. Army building phase
3. Movement and attack phase
4. Technology development phase

### Victory Conditions
- Control 75% of the world's territories
- Control all capital territories
- Eliminate all opposing players

## Game Flow
1. Game starts with players controlling one territory each
2. Players take turns to collect resources, build armies, and attack
3. As players conquer territories, they gain more resources
4. Players can develop technologies to gain advantages
5. The game continues until one player achieves a victory condition
